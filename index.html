            It's 102 degrees. There's a pool outside. There's a Switch console in the living room. There's a computer on the table. There's a magic globe on the table. There's a bouquet of beautiful flowers next to the computer. You smell something good baking in the over. There's a knife hanging. There's a bathroom down a hallway. There's a string hanging from the ceiling. What would you like to do? <br><br>
